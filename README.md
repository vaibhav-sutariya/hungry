## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/vaibhav-sutariya/hungry.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.

3. Get an API key at <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>.

4. Paste an API Key according to below instruction.

### Android

Specify your API key in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
```

### iOS

Specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m`:

```objectivec
#include "AppDelegate.h"
#include "GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h"
#import "GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR KEY HERE"];
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}
@end
```

Or in your swift code, specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import GoogleMaps

@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR KEY HERE")
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
}
```
Opt-in to the embedded views preview by adding a boolean property to the app's `Info.plist` file
